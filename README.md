NReplayGain
============

A ReplayGain implementation in C# .NET

The API for calculating ReplayGain for a single track:
<code><pre>
TrackGain trackGain = new TrackGain(44100, 16);
foreach (sampleSet in track) {
	trackGain.AnalyzeSamples(leftSamples, rightSamples)
}
double gain = trackGain.GetGain();
double peak = trackGain.GetPeak();
</pre></code>

If you also need album gain:
<code><pre>
AlbumGain albumGain = new AlbumGain();
foreach (track in tracks) {
    TrackGain trackGain = new TrackGain(44100, 16);
    foreach (sampleSet in track) {
       trackGain.AnalyzeSamples(leftSamples, rightSamples)
    }
    albumGain.AppendTrack(trackGain);
    double trackGain = trackGain.GetGain();
    double trackPeak = trackGain.GetPeak();
}
double albumGain = albumGain.GetGain();
double albumPeak = albumGain.GetPeak();
</pre></code>

Calls are not thread safe, so if you're processing tracks in multiple threads, just synchronize on albumGain whenever you call AppendTrack.
